# Purpose -Get the DNS settings for a Servers 
# Supported OS: 2016
# Notification: email:  - If 3rd octet on the primary DNS server setting does not match value (i.e.‘14’)

#  How to expland§
# MINOR - cusotmize CSV and TXT file name
# MINOR - cleanup temp files generated during process
# MINOR - customize Mailserver, mailaddress, subject,...
# MINOR - set variable for OS version (OperatingSystem)
# MINOR - write time to output csv file
#
# Workflow
# 1. Gett the server details from the AD and exporting it to CSV file

# 2. From CSV file get the DNS values for NICs
# 3. Search if specific filter matches (value (14) in the 3rd octed
in third octet and send an email

# Part 1
# use Get-ADComputer OS properties and filter a specific OS version and function  and export it to CSV
# Note ExpandPropert

Get-ADComputer -Filter {OperatingSystem -Like "*2016*"}  -Properties * | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Name  | 
Out-File c:\temp\server-list.csv

# Part -2
# By having the OSv version data in the CSV , with the pipe we get each server's name and 
# with Get-Wmiobject the NIC Adapter details can be pulled and filtered by IP
# With DNSServerSearchOrder the the list of DNS IP addresses can be used  
# with the join operator the primary dns can be seperated from the secoundary dns " / " 
# the result can be exporting to CSV


Get-Content c:\temp\server-list.txt | Foreach-Object {Get-Wmiobject -computername $_ Win32_NetworkAdapterConfiguration -Filter "IPEnabled=TRUE"}|Select PSComputerName,@{Name=’DNSServerSearchOrder';Expression={[string]::join(“ / ”, ($_.DNSServerSearchOrder))}} | 
Export-Csv c:\temp\dns.csv

# Part -3
# Below by importing the output and using the filter and Comparison_Operators "-notlike " we are searching with the wildcards
# exporting the filnaloutput which doesnt match the IP.*.*.14.*
# Best method to find the octet is to use the split operators in array..

Import-Csv E:\tes.csv | Select-Object -Prop PSComputerName, DNSServerSearchOrder | Where-Object { $_.DNSServerSearchOrder -notlike '*.*.14.*'}|
Export-Csv c:\temp\date-final.txt

# Part -4
#Using the sendmailmessage attaching the output and sending mail

Send-MailMessage -to "Test itinfo@mycompany.com" -From "Test itinfo@mycompany.com" -Subject "Wrong DNS entry found " -SmtpServer mail.server.com -Attachments c:\temp\date-final.txt
