Downoad Silberligth: 
   Now install Silverlight on your Front End servers using this link http://gj294.co/2e6aMUH.

Create a File Share

Go to your DC and open poweshell
   
$Share='c:\SfB2015'
$ShareName='SfB2015Share'
$Desc='Share for Skype for Business 2015 on Server xyz' 
IF (!(TEST-PATH $Share)) {New-Item -Path $Share -ItemType Directory} 
IF (!(GET-SmbShare $ShareName  -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue) -And (TEST-PATH $Share))
{New-SMBShare -Name $ShareName -Path $Share -FullAccess Administrators -Description "$Desc"}

   You now need to create a file share for the Skype For Business (SfB) front end pool. 
   You can create either a normal windows share or a Distributed File System (DFS) file share if you require high availability.  The file share should not be on one of the front end servers.  
The file share is sued to store shared data of each enterprise edition pool or standard edition server. It stores application, user services and web services data for both enterprise edition and standard edition while enterprise edition also stores windows fabric dump and trace files.
   I will be installing my SfBFileShare on my 2 Domain Controllers.


   I recommend you follow this guide http://gj294.co/2dSrt5s

Configure SQL Server
   Install SQL on a separate Server NOT on the Front End servers.
   The following SQL editions are supported
       Microsoft SQL Server 2014 Standard (64-bit edition), and we recommend running with the latest service pack.
       Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Standard (64-bit edition), and we recommend running with the latest service pack.
       Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 Standard (64-bit edition), and we recommend running with the latest service pack.
       However, I am using SQL 2016 Enterprise Edition 64 Bit.
       You can use this guide if you are not familiar with installing SQL http://gj294.co/2eDqZRC

Create your DNS Records
   Follow this guide to create your DNS records http://gj294.co/2deauLE

Install Administrative Tools
   Insert the media into your SfB Front End Servers and run setup.exe located in x:\setup\amd64\setup.exe
   The installation media requires Microsoft Visual C++ to run so leave that to install it shouldn’t take long.
   Ensure you select Connect to the Internet to check for updates and click Install.
   Once downloaded click Next then you should see the Deployment Wizard:
   Click install Administrative Tools and follow the installation wizard.
   Click Finish once complete then you will be returned to the Deployment Wizard Screen

6. Prepare Active Directory
   Log on as a user that had Schema Admins credentials for your Domain.
   In the Skype for Business Server Deployment Wizard, Click Prepare Active Directory.
   Complete the three sub-steps for Schema, Forest and Domain to prepare Active Directory

7. Define a Topology
   Open Topology Builder from the start menu.
   Select New Topology, and click OK
   Saved the file somewhere, I always put it on my Desktop.
   On the Define the primary domain screen, enter your external domain name that you wish to use as your sip addresses.  
   Normally this is the same as your email domain (eg, microsoft.com), and then click Next.
   Add any additional domains you wish to use, and then click Next.
   Enter a Name and Description for the location, click Next.
   Enter the City, State/Province, and Country/Region Code for the site if you wish, click Next
   Ensure Open the New Front End Wizard when this wizard closes is selected and click Finish, Click Next on the home screen.
   Enter the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the pool, and select Enterprise Edition Front End Pool.  
      This is the DNS name that points to your Load Balancer or you are using for DNS Load Balancing.  
      It is NOT your Front End servers FQDN., Click Next.
 Enter the FQDNs of the servers you are going to deploy in the pool, and then click Next.
    In my environment I only have 2 but this is not recommended in production.  
    For more information on this see http://gj294.co/2e6yX34
    Select the features that you wish to be enabled in this topology, and then click Next.
    Note: You can enable features later.
 Depending on your environment and if you intend to collocate the Mediation server will determine if you select the Mediation Server Colocation check box.  In my lab I will select it.  Click Next.
 Uncheck enable Edge Pool.  This will be configured later.  Click Next.
 You now need to define a new SQL Server instance that you installed earlier to store the SfB pool information, click New.
 Specify the SQL Server FQDN in the Define New SQL Store dialog box.  Click OK., Click Next.
 Select Define a new file share, in the File Server FQDN box, enter the FQDN of your domain if you are using DFS or enter the FQDN of the server that hosts your file share if not.
 Then enter the share name for the file share in the File Share box. 

 I am using a Kemp hardware load balancer to load balance SIP and HTTP(S) traffic.  
    Therefore, we are not selecting the Override internal Web Services pool FQDN check box. 
    This depends how DNS works in your domain and is a more complex discussion outside the scope of this article.

 An Office Online Server (this is the new name for Office Web Apps Server) will be configured later so leave it unchecked and click Finish.

In Topology Builder, right-click the Skype for Business Server top node, and then click Edit Properties
